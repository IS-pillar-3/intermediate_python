    "This notebook for practicing some bash scripting with Jupyter cells. We use the `%%bash` cell magic to send the cell contents to a bash process and capture the results, but you could instead write your answers to a `.sh` file and run them on the command line, the effect is the same.\n",

    "The exercises will require you to use commands and arguments you haven't seen. The manual pages for almost all commands are accessible with the `man` command, so if you need to look up information on a program like `ls` the command `man ls` will give you a scrollable page of info. If you get stuck Google brings up answers to virtually any question, typically on Stack Overflow or related sites.\n",

    "This notebook uses two really useful Jupyter features, `!` lines and `%%bash` cells as described above. Lines in code cells beginning with `!` will be treated like bash commands and will be run when the cell runs, this allows you to mix Python and bash commands in one place. Cells beginning with `%%bash` are treated as bash scripts but be aware that user input can't be done and process control doesn't always behave as expected, it's sometimes best to write to script files and run them separately."
