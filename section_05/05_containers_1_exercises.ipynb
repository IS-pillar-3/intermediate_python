It's not good or secure practice to allow a container command to run internally as root so we have to create an internal user account and run as that.\n",

    "\n",
    "Using a non-root user internally, one without elevated privileges, has solved our security concern but not the file ownership one. Attempting to run the container now with the same command will result in error if `testimages` doesn't have permissions set to allow any user to write to it (which is the default).\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution now is to use the `--user`/`-u` flag to specify the user under which to run the container. The syntax we'll use with this flag is `UID:GID` which you can get with the `id` command, so add `-u $(id -u):$(id -g)` to your `docker run` command and run the container again. Your generated images should be owned by you now."
