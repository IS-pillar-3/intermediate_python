    "\n",
    "The command of a container normally runs under root, this is not necessarily secure and files written to a volume are going to be owned by root. Using an internal unprivileged user account solves this issue but files generated in mount directory are owned by `root`. An alternative solution to using the `--user` flag is to use Linux commands to create a local unprivileged user account with the same UID and GID of the user launching the container. Since UID/GID are the important identifiers for an account, files written to the host file system will be owned by the launching user. The UID and GID can be passed to a Dockerfile through command line arguments to set these values internally, and the `USER` command causes all subsequent operations to be performed using this account.
